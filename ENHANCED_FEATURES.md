# Enhanced AI Psychologist Features

## üöÄ New Features Overview

The AI Psychologist has been significantly enhanced with intelligent therapy mode determination and improved crisis response capabilities.

## üîÑ Automatic Therapy Mode Determination

### How It Works
- **Initial Mode**: Starts with the user-selected therapy mode (CBT, Humanistic, or Psychoanalytic)

- **Dynamic Switching**: Automatically switches between therapy modes based on:
  - Communication style
  - Recurring themes
  - Emotional expression patterns
  - User needs and readiness

### Example Flow
1. **Conversation 1**: User starts with CBT mode
2. **Conversation 2**: AI analyzes patterns (still in CBT)
3. **Conversation 3**: AI determines Humanistic approach is better ‚Üí **Mode Switch!**
4. **Future**: Continues in Humanistic mode, adjusting as needed
