You: I'm feeling really stressed about work lately

AI Psychologist:
I understand that work stress can be really overwhelming. In CBT, we often find it helpful to break down what's causing this stress. Can you tell me more about what specific aspects of work are feeling most challenging right now?

You: My boss keeps giving me impossible deadlines

AI Psychologist:
That sounds incredibly frustrating and unfair. Impossible deadlines can create a lot of anxiety and pressure. Let's work together to identify some strategies that might help. When you think about these deadlines, what thoughts go through your mind? Do you find yourself thinking things like "I'll never get this done" or "I'm going to fail"?

You: summary

ðŸ“‹ Session Summary:
Session Summary: The client discussed work-related stress, specifically mentioning impossible deadlines from their boss. The session focused on identifying cognitive patterns and exploring CBT techniques for managing work stress and anxiety.
