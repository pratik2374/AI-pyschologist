Your agent’s core functions should be structured like a layered framework:

Human-in-the-loop safeguard (HUMUN check)

Since psychological conversations can be sensitive, the agent should flag conversations that may need real human intervention (suicidal ideation, abuse, extreme distress).

This keeps the prototype safe and ethical.

Conversational flow

Input understanding → Parse user message (NLU).

Therapeutic questioning → Ask reflective questions like psychologists ("How did that make you feel?", "Can you tell me more about this situation?").

Assurance & normalization → Validate feelings and reduce stigma.

Confession space → Provide a safe, non-judgmental environment for sharing.

Memory System

Short-Term Memory (STM): Last 2–3 turns stored fully. Helps maintain conversation flow.

Summarized Context: Previous user + agent responses summarized and appended for continuity.

Long-Term Memory (LTM): Full logs stored in a database or file with metadata (topic, emotion, timestamp). Agent can query LTM when patterns emerge (e.g., repeated anxiety themes).

Knowledge Integration

Provide responses grounded in psychological theories (CBT, Humanistic Therapy, Positive Psychology).

Use a knowledge base of psychology books, therapy case studies, and research papers for context-based answers.

This can be implemented later with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

⚡ Action Plan (Prototype in Terminal)

Here’s a step-by-step roadmap you can implement:

Phase 1 – Core Chat Agent

Build a CLI-based chatbot that:

Takes user input (input() in Python).

Stores it in STM (list).

Generates responses using an LLM (e.g., OpenAI API or local GPT4All).

Outputs to terminal.

Phase 2 – Short & Long-Term Memory

STM: Keep a rolling window of 2 turns (user + agent).

LTM: Save all interactions in a structured format:

{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-15T14:05",
  "user": "I feel anxious at night.",
  "agent": "It’s normal to feel anxious sometimes, can you tell me when this started?",
  "tags": ["anxiety", "nighttime"]
}


Store in SQLite or JSON.

Add a retrieval step: When a new message comes, check LTM for past related themes.

Phase 3 – HUMUN Safeguard

Add a safety filter:

If user mentions crisis words (suicide, self-harm, abuse), agent should respond with:

"This sounds very serious. I care about your safety — please reach out to a licensed professional or call a helpline immediately."

This ensures ethical use.

Phase 4 – Psychological Knowledge Integration

Start with preloaded psychological techniques:

Cognitive reframing (CBT).

Stress reduction techniques.

Empathetic affirmations.

Later, integrate books and studies via RAG:

Convert PDFs into embeddings (using FAISS, Chroma).

Query them when user talks about specific conditions.

Phase 5 – Refinement

Add session summaries after each conversation (like therapy notes).

Allow user to type !summary or !history to see what they’ve discussed.

Add optional --mode for different therapy styles:

cbt (structured thought reframing)

humanistic (empathy-focused)

psychoanalytic (digging deeper)

✅ Immediate First Prototype (MVP)

Run in terminal.

Uses OpenAI API (or local LLM).

Keeps last 2 messages (STM).

Logs all chats into JSON as LTM.

Includes crisis safeguard filter.
